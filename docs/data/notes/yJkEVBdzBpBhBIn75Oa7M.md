I tried making multiple vaults.

### Make a local vault
- Use `Dendron: Vault Add` command.
- Make local vault.

### Make a remote repo
- Add a repo in github.

### Change local vault into remote repo
- Use `Dendron: Vault Convert` command.
- Change local vault i made into remote.

### How to update remote repo
- Update/Add your note
- Use `Dendron: Workspace: Sync` command.
